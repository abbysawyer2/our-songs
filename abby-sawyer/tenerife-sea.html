    <h1>Tenerife Sea</h1>
    <h2>Ed Sheeran</h2>
    <p>You look so wonderful in your dress<br> I love your hair like that<br> The way it falls on the side of your neck<br> Down your shoulders and back</p>

    <p>We are surrounded by all of these lies<br> And people who talk too much<br> You've got that kind of look in your eyes<br> As if no one knows anything but us</p>

    <p>And should this be the last thing I see<br> I want you to know it's enough for me<br> 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need</p>

    <p>I'm so in love, so in love<br> So in love, so in love</p>

    <p>You look so beautiful in this light<br> Your silhouette over me<br> The way it brings out the blue in your eyes<br> Is the Tenerife sea</p>And all of the voices surrounding us here

<p>They just fade out when you take a breath<br>
Just say the word and I will disappear<br>
Into the wilderness</p>

<p>And should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need</p>

<p>I'm so in love, so in love<br>
So in love, so in love</p>

<p>Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me</p>

<p>And should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need</p>

<p>I'm so in love, so in love<br>
So in love, love, love, love,<br>
So in love</p>

<p>You look so wonderful in your dress<br>
I loved your hair like that<br>
And in the moment I knew you, Beth</p>
